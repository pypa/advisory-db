id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-49377
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers.
  OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.2 contain reflected XSS vulnerabilities
  in the login dialog and the standalone application key confirmation dialog.  An
  attacker who successfully talked a victim into clicking on a specially crafted login
  link, or a malicious app running on a victim's computer triggering the application
  key workflow with specially crafted parameters and then redirecting the victim to
  the related standalone confirmation dialog could use this to retrieve or modify
  sensitive configuration settings, interrupt prints or otherwise interact with the
  OctoPrint instance in a malicious way. The above mentioned specific vulnerabilities
  of the login dialog and the standalone application key confirmation dialog have
  been patched in the bugfix release 1.10.3 by individual escaping of the detected
  locations. A global change throughout all of OctoPrint's templating system with
  the upcoming 1.11.0 release will handle this further, switching to globally enforced
  automatic escaping and thus reducing the attack surface in general. The latter will
  also improve the security of third party plugins. During a transition period, third
  party plugins will be able to opt into the automatic escaping. With OctoPrint 1.13.0,
  automatic escaping will be switched over to be enforced even for third party plugins,
  unless they explicitly opt-out.
