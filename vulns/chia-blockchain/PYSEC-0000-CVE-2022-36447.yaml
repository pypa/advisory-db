id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-36447
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
details: An inflation issue was discovered in Chia Network CAT1 Standard 1.0.0. Previously
  minted tokens minted on the Chia blockchain using the CAT1 standard can be inflated
  to an arbitrary extent by any holder of any amount of the token. The total amount
  of the token can be increased as high as the malicious actor pleases. This is true
  for every CAT1 on the Chia blockchain regardless of issuance rules. This attack
  is auditable on chain, so maliciously altered coins can potentially be marked by
  off-chain observers as malicious.
