id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2017-12612
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
details: In Apache Spark 1.6.0 until 2.1.1, the launcher API performs unsafe deserialization
  of data received by its socket. This makes applications launched programmatically
  using the launcher API potentially vulnerable to arbitrary code execution by an
  attacker with access to any user account on the local machine. It does not affect
  apps run by spark-submit or spark-shell. The attacker would be able to execute code
  as the user that ran the Spark application. Users are encouraged to update to version
  2.2.0 or later.
