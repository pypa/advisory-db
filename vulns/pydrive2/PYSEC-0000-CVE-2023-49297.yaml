id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-49297
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
details: PyDrive2 is a wrapper library of google-api-python-client that simplifies
  many common Google Drive API V2 tasks. Unsafe YAML deserilization will result in
  arbitrary code execution. A maliciously crafted YAML file can cause arbitrary code
  execution if PyDrive2 is run in the same directory as it, or if it is loaded in
  via `LoadSettingsFile`. This is a deserilization attack that will affect any user
  who initializes GoogleAuth from this package while a malicious yaml file is present
  in the same directory. This vulnerability does not require the file to be directly
  loaded through the code, only present. This issue has been addressed in commit `c57355dc`
  which is included in release version `1.16.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
