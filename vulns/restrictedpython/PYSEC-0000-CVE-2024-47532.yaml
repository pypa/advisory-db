id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-47532
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
details: RestrictedPython is a restricted execution environment for Python to run
  untrusted code. A user can gain access to protected (and potentially sensible) information
  indirectly via AttributeError.obj and the string module. The problem will be fixed
  in version 7.3. As a workaround, If the application does not require access to the
  module string, it can remove it from RestrictedPython.Utilities.utility_builtins
  or otherwise do not make it available in the restricted execution environment.
