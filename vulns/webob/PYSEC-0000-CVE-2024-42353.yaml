id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-42353
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: WebOb provides objects for HTTP requests and responses. When WebOb normalizes
  the HTTP Location header to include the request hostname, it does so by parsing
  the URL that the user is to be redirected to with Python's urlparse, and joining
  it to the base URL. `urlparse` however treats a `//` at the start of a string as
  a URI without a scheme, and then treats the next part as the hostname. `urljoin`
  will then use that hostname from the second part as the hostname replacing the original
  one from the request. This vulnerability is patched in WebOb version 1.8.8.
