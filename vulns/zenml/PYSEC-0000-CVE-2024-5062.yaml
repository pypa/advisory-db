id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-5062
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in zenml-io/zenml
  version 0.57.1. The vulnerability exists due to improper neutralization of input
  during web page generation, specifically within the survey redirect parameter. This
  flaw allows an attacker to redirect users to a specified URL after completing a
  survey, without proper validation of the 'redirect' parameter. Consequently, an
  attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser
  session. This vulnerability could be exploited to steal cookies, potentially leading
  to account takeover.
