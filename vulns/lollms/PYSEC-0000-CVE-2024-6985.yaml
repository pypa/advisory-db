severity:
- type: CVSS_V3

details: A path traversal vulnerability exists in the api open_personality_folder
  endpoint of parisneo/lollms-webui. This vulnerability allows an attacker to read
  any folder in the personality_folder on the victim's computer, even though sanitize_path
  is set. The issue arises due to improper sanitization of the personality_folder
  parameter, which can be exploited to traverse directories and access arbitrary files.
