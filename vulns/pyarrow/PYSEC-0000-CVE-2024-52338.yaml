id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-52338
details: "Deserialization of untrusted data in IPC and Parquet readers in the Apache
  Arrow R package versionsÂ 4.0.0 through 16.1.0 allows arbitrary code execution. An
  application is vulnerable if it \nreads Arrow IPC, Feather or Parquet data from
  untrusted sources (for \nexample, user-supplied input files). This vulnerability
  only affects the arrow R package, not other Apache Arrow \nimplementations or bindings
  unless those bindings are specifically used via the R package (for example, an R
  application that embeds a Python interpreter and uses PyArrow to read files from
  untrusted sources is still vulnerable if the arrow R package is an affected version).
  It is recommended that users of the arrow R package upgrade to 17.0.0 or later.
  Similarly, it\n is recommended that downstream libraries upgrade their dependency
  \nrequirements to arrow 17.0.0 or later. If using an affected\nversion of the package,
  untrusted data can read into a Table and its internal to_data_frame() method can
  be used as a workaround (e.g., read_parquet(..., as_data_frame = FALSE)$to_data_frame()).\n\n\nThis
  issue affects the Apache Arrow R package: from 4.0.0 through 16.1.0.\n\n\nUsers
  are recommended to upgrade to version 17.0.0, which fixes the issue."
