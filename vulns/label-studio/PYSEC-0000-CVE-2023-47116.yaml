id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-47116
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
details: Label Studio is a popular open source data labeling tool. The vulnerability
  affects all versions of Label Studio prior to 1.11.0 and was tested on version 1.8.2.
  Label Studio's SSRF protections that can be enabled by setting the `SSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED`
  environment variable can be bypassed to access internal web servers. This is because
  the current SSRF validation is done by executing a single DNS lookup to verify that
  the IP address is not in an excluded subnet range. This protection can be bypassed
  by either using HTTP redirection or performing a DNS rebinding attack.
