id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2014-2237
details: The memcache token backend in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) 2013.1 through
  2.013.1.4, 2013.2 through 2013.2.2, and icehouse before icehouse-3, when issuing
  a trust token with impersonation enabled, does not include this token in the trustee's
  token-index-list, which prevents the token from being invalidated by bulk token
  revocation and allows the trustee to bypass intended access restrictions.
