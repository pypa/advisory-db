severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
details: Excessive directory permissions in MLflow leads to local privilege escalation
  when using spark_udf. This behavior can be exploited by a local attacker to gain
  elevated permissions by using a ToCToU attack. The issue is only relevant when the
  spark_udf() MLflow API is called.
