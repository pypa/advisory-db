id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-8113
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: Stored XSS in organizer and event settings of pretix up to 2024.7.0 allows
  malicious event organizers to inject HTML tags into e-mail previews on settings
  page. The default Content Security Policy of pretix prevents execution of attacker-provided
  scripts, making exploitation unlikely. However, combined with a CSP bypass (which
  is not currently known) the vulnerability could be used to impersonate other organizers
  or staff users.
