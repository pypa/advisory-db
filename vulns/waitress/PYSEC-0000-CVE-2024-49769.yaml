id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-49769
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
details: Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When
  a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to
  call getpeername() waitress won't correctly clean up the connection leading to the
  main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing
  it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling
  the write function. A remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets
  with very little resources required. Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the
  race condition.
