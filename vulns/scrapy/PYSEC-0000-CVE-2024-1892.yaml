id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-1892
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
details: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the
  XMLFeedSpider class of the scrapy/scrapy project, specifically in the parsing of
  XML content. By crafting malicious XML content that exploits inefficient regular
  expression complexity used in the parsing process, an attacker can cause a denial-of-service
  (DoS) condition. This vulnerability allows for the system to hang and consume significant
  resources, potentially rendering services that utilize Scrapy for XML processing
  unresponsive.
