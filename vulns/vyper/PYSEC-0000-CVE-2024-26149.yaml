id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-26149
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
details: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine.
  If an excessively large value is specified as the starting index for an array in
  `_abi_decode`, it can cause the read position to overflow. This results in the decoding
  of values outside the intended array bounds, potentially leading to exploitations
  in contracts that use arrays within `_abi_decode`. This vulnerability affects 0.3.10
  and earlier versions.
