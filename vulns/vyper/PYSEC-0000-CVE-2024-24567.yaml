id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-24567
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
details: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine.
  Vyper compiler allows passing a value in builtin raw_call even if the call is a
  delegatecall or a staticcall. But in the context of delegatecall and staticcall
  the handling of value is not possible due to the semantics of the respective opcodes,
  and vyper will silently ignore the value= argument. If the semantics of the EVM
  are unknown to the developer, he could suspect that by specifying the `value` kwarg,
  exactly the given amount will be sent along to the target. This vulnerability affects
  0.3.10 and earlier versions.
