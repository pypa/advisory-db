id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-32645
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
details: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine.
  In versions 0.3.10 and prior, incorrect values can be logged when `raw_log` builtin
  is called with memory or storage arguments to be used as topics. A contract search
  was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. The `build_IR`
  function of the `RawLog` class fails to properly unwrap the variables provided as
  topics. Consequently, incorrect values are logged as topics. As of time of publication,
  no fixed version is available.
