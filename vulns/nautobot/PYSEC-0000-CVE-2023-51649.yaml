id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-51649
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
details: 'Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built
  as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or MySQL
  database. When submitting a Job to run via a Job Button, only the model-level `extras.run_job`
  permission is checked (i.e., does the user have permission to run Jobs in general).
  Object-level permissions (i.e., does the user have permission to run this specific
  Job?) are not enforced by the URL/view used in this case. A user with permissions
  to run even a single Job can actually run all configured JobButton Jobs. Fix will
  be available in Nautobot 1.6.8 and 2.1.0 '
