id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-47871
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
details: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This
  vulnerability involves **insecure communication** between the FRP (Fast Reverse
  Proxy) client and server when Gradio's `share=True` option is used. HTTPS is not
  enforced on the connection, allowing attackers to intercept and read files uploaded
  to the Gradio server, as well as modify responses or data sent between the client
  and server. This impacts users who are sharing Gradio demos publicly over the internet
  using `share=True` without proper encryption, exposing sensitive data to potential
  eavesdroppers. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue.
  As a workaround, users can avoid using `share=True` in production environments and
  instead host their Gradio applications on servers with HTTPS enabled to ensure secure
  communication.
