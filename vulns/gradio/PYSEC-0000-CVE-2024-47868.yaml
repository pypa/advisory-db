id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-47868
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
details: 'Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping.
  This is a **data validation vulnerability** affecting several Gradio components,
  which allows arbitrary file leaks through the post-processing step. Attackers can
  exploit these components by crafting requests that bypass expected input constraints.
  This issue could lead to sensitive files being exposed to unauthorized users, especially
  when combined with other vulnerabilities, such as issue TOB-GRADIO-15. The components
  most at risk are those that return or handle file data. Vulnerable Components: 1.
  **String to FileData:** DownloadButton, Audio, ImageEditor, Video, Model3D, File,
  UploadButton. 2. **Complex data to FileData:** Chatbot, MultimodalTextbox. 3. **Direct
  file read in preprocess:** Code. 4. **Dictionary converted to FileData:** ParamViewer,
  Dataset. Exploit Scenarios: 1. A developer creates a Dropdown list that passes values
  to a DownloadButton. An attacker bypasses the allowed inputs, sends an arbitrary
  file path (like `/etc/passwd`), and downloads sensitive files. 2. An attacker crafts
  a malicious payload in a ParamViewer component, leaking sensitive files from a server
  through the arbitrary file leak. This issue has been resolved in `gradio>5.0`. Upgrading
  to the latest version will mitigate this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.'
