id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-47165
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This
  vulnerability relates to **CORS origin validation accepting a null origin**. When
  a Gradio server is deployed locally, the `localhost_aliases` variable includes "null"
  as a valid origin. This allows attackers to make unauthorized requests from sandboxed
  iframes or other sources with a null origin, potentially leading to data theft,
  such as user authentication tokens or uploaded files. This impacts users running
  Gradio locally, especially those using basic authentication. Users are advised to
  upgrade to `gradio>=5.0` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can manually
  modify the `localhost_aliases` list in their local Gradio deployment to exclude
  "null" as a valid origin. By removing this value, the Gradio server will no longer
  accept requests from sandboxed iframes or sources with a null origin, mitigating
  the potential for exploitation.
