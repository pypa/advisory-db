id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-47870
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
details: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This
  vulnerability involves a **race condition** in the `update_root_in_config` function,
  allowing an attacker to modify the `root` URL used by the Gradio frontend to communicate
  with the backend. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can redirect user traffic
  to a malicious server. This could lead to the interception of sensitive data such
  as authentication credentials or uploaded files. This impacts all users who connect
  to a Gradio server, especially those exposed to the internet, where malicious actors
  could exploit this race condition. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to
  address this issue. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
