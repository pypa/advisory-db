id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-47869
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
details: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This
  vulnerability involves a **timing attack** in the way Gradio compares hashes for
  the `analytics_dashboard` function. Since the comparison is not done in constant
  time, an attacker could exploit this by measuring the response time of different
  requests to infer the correct hash byte-by-byte. This can lead to unauthorized access
  to the analytics dashboard, especially if the attacker can repeatedly query the
  system with different keys. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>4.44` to mitigate
  this issue. To mitigate the risk before applying the patch, developers can manually
  patch the `analytics_dashboard` dashboard to use a **constant-time comparison**
  function for comparing sensitive values, such as hashes. Alternatively, access to
  the analytics dashboard can be disabled.
