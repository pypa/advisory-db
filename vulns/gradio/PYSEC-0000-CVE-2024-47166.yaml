id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-47166
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
details: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This
  vulnerability involves a **one-level read path traversal** in the `/custom_component`
  endpoint. Attackers can exploit this flaw to access and leak source code from custom
  Gradio components by manipulating the file path in the request. Although the traversal
  is limited to a single directory level, it could expose proprietary or sensitive
  code that developers intended to keep private. This impacts users who have developed
  custom Gradio components and are hosting them on publicly accessible servers. Users
  are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=4.44` to address this issue. As a workaround,
  developers can sanitize the file paths and ensure that components are not stored
  in publicly accessible directories.
