id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-47164
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This
  vulnerability relates to the **bypass of directory traversal checks** within the
  `is_in_or_equal` function. This function, intended to check if a file resides within
  a given directory, can be bypassed with certain payloads that manipulate file paths
  using `..` (parent directory) sequences. Attackers could potentially access restricted
  files if they are able to exploit this flaw, although the difficulty is high. This
  primarily impacts users relying on Gradioâ€™s blocklist or directory access validation,
  particularly when handling file uploads. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5.0`
  to address this issue. As a workaround, users can manually sanitize and normalize
  file paths in their Gradio deployment before passing them to the `is_in_or_equal`
  function. Ensuring that all file paths are properly resolved and absolute can help
  mitigate the bypass vulnerabilities caused by the improper handling of `..` sequences
  or malformed paths.
