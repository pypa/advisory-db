id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-47168
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
details: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This
  vulnerability involves data exposure due to the enable_monitoring flag not properly
  disabling monitoring when set to False. Even when monitoring is supposedly disabled,
  an attacker or unauthorized user can still access the monitoring dashboard by directly
  requesting the /monitoring endpoint. This means that sensitive application analytics
  may still be exposed, particularly in environments where monitoring is expected
  to be disabled. Users who set enable_monitoring=False to prevent unauthorized access
  to monitoring data are impacted. Users are advised to upgrade to gradio>=4.44 to
  address this issue. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
