id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-47872
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This
  vulnerability involves **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** on any Gradio server that
  allows file uploads. Authenticated users can upload files such as HTML, JavaScript,
  or SVG files containing malicious scripts. When other users download or view these
  files, the scripts will execute in their browser, allowing attackers to perform
  unauthorized actions or steal sensitive information from their sessions. This impacts
  any Gradio server that allows file uploads, particularly those using components
  that process or display user-uploaded files. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5`
  to address this issue. As a workaround, users can restrict the types of files that
  can be uploaded to the Gradio server by limiting uploads to non-executable file
  types such as images or text. Additionally, developers can implement server-side
  validation to sanitize uploaded files, ensuring that HTML, JavaScript, and SVG files
  are properly handled or rejected before being stored or displayed to users.
