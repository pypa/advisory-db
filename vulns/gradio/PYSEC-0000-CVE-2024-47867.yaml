id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-47867
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
details: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This
  vulnerability is a **lack of integrity check** on the downloaded FRP client, which
  could potentially allow attackers to introduce malicious code. If an attacker gains
  access to the remote URL from which the FRP client is downloaded, they could modify
  the binary without detection, as the Gradio server does not verify the file's checksum
  or signature.  Any users utilizing the Gradio server's sharing mechanism that downloads
  the FRP client could be affected by this vulnerability, especially those relying
  on the executable binary for secure data tunneling. There is no direct workaround
  for this issue without upgrading. However, users can manually validate the integrity
  of the downloaded FRP client by implementing checksum or signature verification
  in their own environment to ensure the binary hasn't been tampered with.
