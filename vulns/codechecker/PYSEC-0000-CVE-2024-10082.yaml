id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-10082
details: "CodeChecker is an analyzer tooling, defect database and viewer extension\
  \ for the Clang Static Analyzer and Clang Tidy. \nAuthentication method confusion\
  \ allows logging in as the built-in root user from an external service. The built-in\
  \ root user up until 6.24.1 is generated in a weak manner, cannot be disabled, and\
  \ has universal access.This vulnerability allows an attacker who can create an account\
  \ on an enabled external authentication service, to log in as the root user, and\
  \ access and control everything that can be controlled via the web interface.\_\
  The attacker needs to acquire the username of the root user to be successful.\n\n\
  This issue affects CodeChecker: through 6.24.1."
