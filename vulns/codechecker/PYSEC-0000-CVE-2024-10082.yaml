id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-10082
details: "CodeChecker is an analyzer tooling, defect database and viewer extension
  for the Clang Static Analyzer and Clang Tidy. \nAuthentication method confusion
  allows logging in as the built-in root user from an external service. The built-in
  root user up until 6.24.1 is generated in a weak manner, cannot be disabled, and
  has universal access.This vulnerability allows an attacker who can create an account
  on an enabled external authentication service, to log in as the root user, and access
  and control everything that can be controlled via the web interface.Â The attacker
  needs to acquire the username of the root user to be successful.\n\nThis issue affects
  CodeChecker: through 6.24.1."
