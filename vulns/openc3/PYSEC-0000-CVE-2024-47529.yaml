severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
details: OpenC3 COSMOS provides the functionality needed to send commands to and receive
  data from one or more embedded systems. OpenC3 COSMOS stores the password of a user
  unencrypted in the LocalStorage of a web browser. This makes the user password susceptible
  to exfiltration via Cross-site scripting (see GHSL-2024-128). This vulnerability
  is fixed in 5.19.0. This only affects Open Source edition, and not OpenC3 COSMOS
  Enterprise Edition.
